## Monitoring & Observability

### Health Checks
- **Liveness**: `GET /api/v1/health/live`
- **Readiness**: `GET /api/v1/health/ready`
- **Health**: `GET /api/v1/health`

### Logging
- **Structured Logging**: JSON-formatted logs with request IDs and metadata
- **CloudWatch Integration**: Ready for AWS CloudWatch log aggregation

## Data Lake Integration

### **Automatic Data Storage**
All prediction requests are automatically stored in AWS S3/Athena data lake for analytics:

**Storage Pattern:**
- **Raw Features**: Original input data with `raw_` prefix
- **Engineered Features**: Model-processed features with `engineered_` prefix  
- **Flattened Custom Features**: `custom_feature_*` stored as individual columns
- **Prediction Results**: Scores, confidence, processing metadata
- **Partitioning**: By year/month/day for efficient querying

**Data Lake Schema:**
```sql
-- Athena table structure
CREATE TABLE lead_score_prod (
    request_id string,
    lead_id string,
    model_version string,
    timestamp timestamp,
    score int,
    confidence double,
    features_used int,
    processing_time_ms double,
    -- Raw input features
    raw_company_size string,
    raw_industry string,
    raw_email_engagement_score double,
    raw_custom_feature_1 double,
    raw_custom_feature_2 double,
    -- ... (all 50+ features)
    -- Engineered features
    engineered_company_size_encoded int,
    engineered_email_engagement_score double,
    -- ... (all model features)
) PARTITIONED BY (
    year int,
    month int, 
    day int
)
```

## Load Testing & Performance Validation

### **Environment-Aware Testing Strategy**

**Development Environment:**
```bash
# Full performance testing suite
ENV=dev python tests/test_load.py
ENV=dev pytest tests/test_load.py -v

# Tests included:
- Single request performance (<1s)
- Batch processing (5-50 leads)  
- Concurrent load testing (20 requests, 5 concurrent)
- Stress testing (50 requests, 10 concurrent)
- Maximum batch size validation (500 leads)
```

**Production Environment:**
```bash  
# Conservative smoke testing only
ENV=prod python tests/test_load.py
ENV=prod pytest tests/test_load.py::test_single_request_load -v

# Smoke tests included:
- Single request validation
- Basic batch processing
- Health endpoint verification
- Performance baseline (<10s threshold)
```

### **Performance Benchmarks**

**Development Targets:**
- Success Rate: ≥95%
- Average Response Time: <2 seconds
- P95 Response Time: <5 seconds
- Throughput: ≥2 requests/second
- Concurrent Capacity: 5+ concurrent requests

**Production Baselines:**
- Success Rate: ≥90% (under stress)
- Single Request: <1 second
- Batch Processing: <10 seconds
- Health Check Response: <500ms

### **Smoke Test Data Safety**

**Test Data Identification:**
All smoke tests use clearly identifiable request IDs for easy filtering:

```python
# Production smoke test patterns
"prod-verification"      # Health check test
"prod-baseline-test"     # Performance baseline
"load-test-{num}-{timestamp}"  # Load test pattern
```

**Data Lake Filtering:**
```sql
-- Exclude all test data from business analytics
SELECT * FROM lead_score_prod 
WHERE request_id NOT LIKE 'prod-%' 
  AND request_id NOT LIKE 'load-test-%';

-- Find all smoke test data for auditing
SELECT * FROM lead_score_prod 
WHERE request_id IN ('prod-verification', 'prod-baseline-test');
```

**Data Safety Guarantees:**
- **No CRM Data Corruption**: Tests only write to analytics data lake
- **Easily Identifiable**: Clear request ID patterns for filtering
- **Minimal Footprint**: 1-2 test records per smoke test run
- **No Business Logic Impact**: Read-only operations on production data

## Comprehensive CI/CD Pipeline

### **Quality Gates (All Environments)**

## Important Technical Decisions (ITDs)

### **ITD.1 - Use a dummy model in MVP for demo**
**Problem:** What kind of model should we use for creating a lead scoring inferencing system?

**Options Considered:**
1. **Use a dummy model in MVP** ✓
2. Train Model using Kaggle Dataset to show real integration in production

**Reasoning:** Option (2) is infeasible in the MVP as we do not have large scale customer data that can be used to create a model. Also the training and tweaking the model would take time.

### **ITD.2 - FastAPI to develop the application**
**Problem:** What framework should we use to create this production application?

**Options Considered:**
1. Use Flask to develop the application
2. Use Django to develop the application
3. **Use FastAPI to develop the application** ✓

**Reasoning:** Even though Flask and Django are excellent backend framework with built-in libraries for ORM. The FastAPI would be much better for our use case since it is light and provide faster response with minimal code needed. If authentication and authorization were priority like most backend application, then Django should be preferred.

### **ITD.3 - Using GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipeline**
**Problem:** Which CI/CD framework we should use in application?

**Options Considered:**
1. **GitHub Actions** ✓
2. Jenkins

**Reasoning:** Using GitHub actions since it is easier to maintain and requires very less effort to setup. It is seamlessly integrated with GitHub. Also, our use case is limited to one repo. Jenkins should be preferred in case we have multiple repositories, since Jenkins provide large number of plugins and features to automate the process.

### **ITD.4 - Using Load Balancer + ECS Fargate to deploy our inferencing framework**
**Problem:** Which AWS service and deployment strategy to use for a scalable deployment?

**Options Considered:**
1. **Load Balancer + ECS Fargate** ✓
2. API Gateway + Lambda
3. Load Balancer + EKS

**Reasoning:** 
- **API Gateway + Lambda** – Most easy setup with high level of abstraction. CI/CD automation could be handled via SAM in GitHub Actions. But has a cold start problem with limitation of the code size when hitting the instance. No systematic deployment. No rolling update feature or Blue/Green deployment option. Cheaper if low hits but costly in real-time scenario.
- **Load Balancer + ECS Fargate** – Moderate learning curve with highly auto scalable feature. Scales per container and highly secure based upon VPC and subnet configuration. Easier to maintain once setup is done. Good for a small person team and starting MVP.
- **Load Balancer + EKS** – High Learning curve with cluster management and K8s expertise required. Scales pods and clusters. Pay for control plane and underlying compute nodes. Good for large scale companies with many clusters in production and a dedicated team handling K8s infra.

### **ITD.5 - Comprehensive Quality Gates with Zero-Tolerance Security Policy**
**Problem:** How to ensure code quality, security, and reliability before deployment to production environments?

**Options Considered:**
1. **Comprehensive Quality Gates with Zero-Tolerance Security Policy** ✓
2. Basic linting and testing only
3. Manual code review process

**Reasoning:** Option (2) is insufficient for production ML systems handling sensitive lead data. Option (3) doesn't scale and is prone to human error. The comprehensive approach ensures:
- 75% minimum code coverage requirement prevents undertested code
- Zero security issues tolerance using Bandit and Trivy
- Multi-layer vulnerability scanning (filesystem + container)
- Automated quality checks prevent manual oversight
- Critical for ML systems where data security and model reliability are paramount

### **ITD.6 - Environment-Specific Deployment Strategy with Load Testing**
**Problem:** How to manage deployments across different environments while ensuring performance validation?

**Options Considered:**
1. **Separate DEV/PROD pipelines with environment-aware testing** ✓
2. Manual deployment process
3. Single environment deployment

**Reasoning:** Option (2) is error-prone and doesn't scale. Option (3) lacks proper testing isolation. The chosen approach provides:
- Branch-based deployment (dev branch → DEV environment, main branch → PROD)
- Full load testing in DEV (safe to stress test)
- Conservative smoke testing in PROD (minimize risk to live users)
- Automated service health verification with performance baselines
- Clear data safety with identifiable test patterns
